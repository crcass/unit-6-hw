# Super Search!

### One-click Search for gifs, movie posters, and character bios

The user can select any of the pre-made buttons to load gifs, posters, and a bio for each character.
The user may user the text field to enter their own character. If the character adds their own, a new button will appear that functions just like the pre-made buttons.

The gifs start off as still images. If the user clicks on a gif, it will start to play. Clicking on a gif that is playing will stop it from playing.

When the gifs populate, a new button will appear at the bottom of the gif list that will load 10 more gifs without reloading the page or clearing the gifs that have already populated.

### Known Issues
* The API that shows the character bios is slow
* The user may find that some characters are hard to find, try sticking to more popular characters
* A few characters, even popular characters, don't have bios. This is a limitation of the API
* Styling is bland
